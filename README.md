## The Game
As the incoming general manager of Mars Mining Co.'s Orbital Excavation division, you are reponsible for all off-planet mining operations. You will have full automony in the division's day-to-day operations, subject to the board's approval. Act wisely, as the livelihood and lives of countless individuals depend on your decisions...including your own.

###Genre
***Simulation, Worker Management***

### Description
Mars Mining Co. is a single player browser-based game, written in Javascript (ECMAScript 6).

The goal of the game is to manage the Orbital Excavation division for the Mars Mining Co., turning a profit while balancing business relationships with your subordinates and superiors. You have full control to run the Orbital Excavation division as you see fit, harvesting the vast resources of the Asteroid Belt for humanity, so long as the board approves.

To manage the Orbital Excavation division, you will be given an acount to access MMC's managerial software and databases. From your terminal, you will have access to employee information, financial information, up-to-date forecasts, and everything else you might need to know about the inner workings of the division and company. You will also be able to set directives, send communications, manage hiring and firing of personnel, create purchase orders for spaceships and equipment, and so much more, all from the convenience of your personal terminal.

Although the terminal will be the only view into the game, the goal is to provide a detailed simulation of the world (down to individual employee behaviors and spaceship collisions) that will drive the events and decisions for each playthrough. Each employee will have their own AI and behavior, which will cascade into interesting and unpredictable interactions and challenges as the simulation progresses and you stake your claim across the Asteroid Belt.

### Setting
The game is set in the "somewhat distant future", where humanity has started its inevitable expansion into the Solar System. Thriving colonies span the Moon and Mars, and humanity's outposts reach ever further throughout the system. To fuel this rapid expansion, the powers of industry have also turned their eyes to the skies, transforming Mars into a manufacturing hub that rivals Earth.

Driven by an unrelenting quest for ever increasing growth and profits, Mars Mining Co. is largely responsible for the extensive developments that now cover the Martian landscape (which is reflected in their stock price). However, the days of vast untapped ore and mineral deposits spanning the Martian surface are coming to end, forcing mining operations ever deeper into the subterranien, dragging profit margins down along with them. Looking past the Martian horizon and the core of the industry that built MMC into the mega-corp it is today, the board is once again raising their eyes to the skies. With a new found calling (and a whole bunch of government subsidies), the board has their sights set on transforming the vast Asteriod Belt sitting between Mars and Jupiter into their latest profit stream, for Q3 and beyond.

And now, having worked you way into the graces of the board over countless late nights, you have been selected to lead MMC's brand new Orbital Excavation division.

## Project Info
The game is still in the extremly early stages of development, and there is not any playable content yet. The current focus is coding the simulation that will be the primary driving mechanism behind the gameplay, before adding the user interface that will serve as the player's portal into the simulation.
